Notes:

* D13 is also linked to on-board LED.
* D0 and D1 are actually labelled as RX and TX respectively, i.e. they're treated as Serial1.

`uart-discovery.py` shows the following combinations as valid but they aren't as D5 is level shifted for 5V _output_.

    TX pin: board.A2      RX pin: board.D5                    
    TX pin: board.SCL     RX pin: board.D5                     
    TX pin: board.SDA     RX pin: board.D5                     

Note cut out of my Betaflight modifications:

```
// SAMD51 seems to be more flexible than STM32 - there doesn't seem to be a concept of USART1 etc.
// There are just a whole load of pins that can be paired to form UARTs - see:
// https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-itsybitsy-m4?view=all#wheres-my-uart-2985036-19
// If we look in ports/atmel-samd/asf4/samd51/include/samd51g19a.h we can see it pulls in
// sercom0.h to sercom5.h - a SERCOM covers I2C, SPI and USART - I'm taking this as meaning one
// can have up to 6 USARTs (or I2Cs or SPIs but at most 6 of all three combined).
// UARTDEV_COUNT_MAX allows you to enumerate up that count of pins for each UARTs RX and TX pins,
// again I don't think things are so fixed as for STM32. Particular
// pins aren't limited to a particular UART, e.g. UART1.
// I'm just leaving the UARTHARDWARE_MAX_PINS at 4 for the moment.
